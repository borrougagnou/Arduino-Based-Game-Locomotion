# Arduino-Based-Game-Locomotion
Game locomotion system based on Arduino
This project is about creating an arduino based locomotion system for gaming. 
The scope is to control the potentiometers of the joystick of a controller with pressure sensors and accelerometers for achieving locomotion in games.
It is possible to create custom shoes that have 2 pressure sensors and 1 accelerometer per foot. In game forwar movements is achieved through the accelerometers while in game lateral movements and backwards movements are achieven with the use of pressure sensors.
