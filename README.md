Game locomotion system based on Arduino. 

This project is about creating an arduino based locomotion system for gaming. The scope is to control the potentiometers of the joystick or to replace a joystick) of a controller, with pressure sensors and accelerometers for achieving locomotion in games. It is possible to create custom shoes that have 2 pressure sensors and 1 accelerometer per foot. In game forward movements are achieved through the accelerometers; while in game lateral movements and backwards movements are achieved with the use of pressure sensors.

What is needed:

1) Four pressure sensors
2) two accelerometers
3) two servomotors (method for no servomotor use also implemented, by using digipots)
4) any PC or console gamepad controller that use a Joystick for locomotion (joystick with potentiometers or without potentiometers); and/or any VR controller that have Joystick (joystick that have potentiometers or without potentiometers)
5) pair of shoes to mount the sensors on 
6) Arduino UNO or Mega,  or "Arduino Due and Mega" for locomotion in VR using custom vive controller based on matzman666 modified arduino usb host library

This locomotion method works for any PC game and for any console game and for vr games . For VR games this method can be used where in the vr game the movements are controlled by the joystick of a vr controller by hooking up the circuit to the joystick of a vr controller or replacing the joystick;
 or it can be used in VR games by makimg a custom vive controller and replacing its joystick with this custom locomotion system
