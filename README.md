Arduino-Based-Game-Locomotion.
Game locomotion system based on Arduino. 

This project is about creating an arduino based locomotion system for gaming. The scope is to control the potentiometers of the joystick of a controller with pressure sensors and accelerometers for achieving locomotion in games. It is possible to create custom shoes that have 2 pressure sensors and 1 accelerometer per foot. In game forward movements are achieved through the accelerometers; while in game lateral movements and backwards movements are achieved with the use of pressure sensors.

What is needed:

1) Four pressure sensors
2) two accelerometers
3) two servomotors
4) any PC or console gamepad controller that have potentiometers in Joystick; and/or any VR controller that have potentiometers in Joystick
5) pair of shoes to mount the sensors on 
6) Arduino UNO
